  abstract = {Liposome formation and lipid swelling on platinum electrodes in distilled
	water and water solutions in d.c. electrical fields have been investigated
	for different amounts of a negatively charged lipid (mixture from
	71% PC, 21.5% PE and 7.5% PS), and a neutral lipid (DMPC). Negatively
	charged lipids do not form liposomes without field when the thickness
	of the dried lipid layer is of the order or less than that corresponding
	to 90 bilayers. The rate and extent of swelling of layers thicker
	than 90 bilayers is largest on the cathode, smaller without fields
	and smallest on the anode. The theory, based on the assumption that
	osmotic and electrostatic forces drive lipid swelling and liposome
	formation, is in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental
	data; in particular, it gives the observed linear dependence of the
	rate of swelling on the inverse lipid layer thickness. To induce
	liposome formation for layers thinner than 90 bilayers it was necessary
	to apply a negative potential which is proportional to the logarithm
	of the inversed layer thickness. The characteristic critical potential
	is proportional to RTk/F; R being the gas constant, Tk the absolute
	temperature and F the Faraday constant. This indicates that redistribution
	of counterions may be the cause which increases the repulsive electrostatic
	intermembrane forces to overcome van der Waals attraction. For thicknesses
	below 10 bilayers, formation of very thin-walled liposomes of narrow
	size distribution and mean diameter of the order of 30 m was observed.
	These liposomes grow in size before detachment and a formula for
	the kinetics of growth has been derived, which is in very good agreement
	with the experimental data. The effects of d.c. fields on DMPC swelling
	are smaller and lead to formation of liposome-like structures of
	different appearence. Bilayer separation and bending are prerequisites
	for liposome formation from hydrating lipids. Therefore, a possible
	molecular mechanism is that membranes should be destabilized to bend
	and fuse to form liposomes. This requires the right proportion between
	structured regions, in the form of bilayers, and defects and/or non-bilayer
	structures, and in many cases external constraints, in particular,
	electrical fields.},

	Incorporation into GUVs containing phase-separating lipids revealed

	an intrinsic preference for the liquid-disordered phase. Although
	the picture from detergent resistance assays on whole cells is ambiguous,
	reconstitutions of components of the exocytic machinery into GUVs

  journal = {Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {690},
  pages = {227-261},
  number = { },
  abstract = { ABSTRACT Vesicles are drops of radius of a few tens of micrometres
	bounded by an impermeable lipid membrane of approximately 4 nm thickness
	in a viscous fluid. The salient characteristics of such a deformable
	object are a membrane rigidity governed by flexion due to curvature
	energy and a two-dimensional membrane fluidity characterized by a
	local membrane incompressibility. This provides unique properties
	with strong constraints on the internal volume and membrane area.
	Yet, when subjected to external stresses, vesicles exhibit a large
	deformability. The deformation of a settling vesicle in an infinite
	flow is studied theoretically, assuming a quasispherical shape and
	expanding all variables of the problem onto spherical harmonics.
	The contribution of thermal fluctuations is neglected in this analysis.
	A system of equations describing the temporal evolution of the shape
	is derived with this formalism. The final shape and the settling
	velocity are then determined and depend on two dimensionless parameters:
	the Bond number and the excess area. This simultaneous study leads
	to three stationary shapes, an egg-like shape already observed in
	an analogous experimental configuration in the limit of weak flow
	magnitude (Chatkaew, Georgelin, Jaeger & Leonetti, Phys. Rev. Lett,
	2009, vol. 103(24), 248103), a parachute-like shape and a non-trivial
	non-axisymmetrical shape. The final shape depends on the initial
	conditions: prolate or oblate vesicle and orientation compared with
	gravity. The analytical solution in the small deformation regime
	is compared with numerical results obtained with a three-dimensional
	code. A very good agreement between numerical and theoretical results
	is found. },

	G(R12, ω) for the flicker intensities measured at two different points
	r 1 r2 on the cell surface, at various filtering frequencies ω. We
	find that the shape of G is universal and involves only one characteristic
	length λ(ω) varying like ω-n, where 0.12 < n < 0.19. Measurements
	of G(0, ω) (i.e. at a single point) show an ω-m dependence, where
	1.30 < m < 1.45. These results are then interpreted theoretically
	in term of thermal fluctuations of the cell thickness. In physiological
	conditions the membrane surface tension vanishes exactly and the
	resistance to deformation is mainly due to curvature energy. In this
	approximation : a) the fluctuations are of very large amplitude (a
	fraction of a micron) as required by the observations ; b) the detailed
	shape of the correlations is in rather good agreement with the theory
	; c) the scaling length λ(ω) is expected to vary like ω-1/6; d) the
	single point spectrum G(0, ω) should go like ω-4/3. The approximation
	involves the neglect of some non linear effects related to surface
	tension and to the Evans elastic energy. We show that the inclusion
	of non linear terms leads to a problem related to the critical point
	of a (special) two dimensional magnetic system. Our approximation
	(equivalent to a mean field theory) essentially ignores the exponent
	correction η introduced by Fisher for phase transitions. Thus, the
	experimental evidence favours a rather small η. We conclude that
	a purely physical interpretation of the flicker effect is sufficient,
	but that rather stringent physiological conditions are required to
	maintain the zero surface tension which is crucial to the effect.},

	examination of leukocytes under physiologic flow conditions. Several
	design modifications have occurred over the years, yet a comparison
	of these different designs has not been performed. In addition, the
	reagent requirements of many designs prohibit the study of rare leukocyte
	populations and require large amounts of reagents.RESULTS:In this
	study, we evaluate modifications to a newer parallel plate flow chamber
	design in comparison to the original parallel plate flow chamber
	described by Lawrence et al. We show that modifications in the chamber
	size, internal tubing diameters, injection valves, and a recirculation
	design may dramatically reduce the cellular and reagent requirements
	without altering measurements.CONCLUSIONS:These modifications are
	simple and easily implemented so that study of rare leukocyte subsets
	using scarce or expensive reagents can occur.},

	the stability of PIP2-containing GUVs. Using confocal microscopy,
	we found that long-chain (C16) fluorescent PIP2 analogs used as tracers

	whereas PIP2 antibodies show PIP2 clustering. However, the clustering
	effect, which is emphasized when tertiary antibodies are used in
	addition to secondary ones to enhance the size of the detection complex,
	is artifactual. We showed that divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) can
	induce aggregation of PIP2 in the membrane depending on their concentration.
	Finally, the interaction of ezrin with PIP2-containing GUVs was investigated.
	Using either labeled ezrin and unlabeled GUVs or both labeled ezrin

	in monolayer or multibilayers of a DOPC/cholesterol/DOPE/DOPG (6/5/3/2)

	the FP23 insertion. The infra-red results show the structural polymorphism
	of the FP23 and its ability to transit quasi irreversibly from an
	α-helix to antiparallel β-sheets. At the air/water interface, the
	transition is induced by compression of the peptide alone and is
	modulated by compression and lipid to peptide ratio (Ri) when FP23
	is inserted into a lipid monolayer. In multibilayers and in a single
	bilayer, there is coexistence in quasi equal proportions of α-helix
	and antiparallel β-sheets of FP23 at low peptide content (Ri = 100,
	200) while antiparallel β-sheets are predominant at high FP23 concentration
	(Ri = 50). In (multi)bilayer systems, evaluation of dichroic ratios
	and sprectral simulations show that both the α-helix and the antiparallel
	β-sheets are tilted at diluted FP23 concentrations (tilt angle of

	an increase of the lipid chain disorder which shows both by an increase
	of the methylene stretching frequencies and an increase of the average
	C–C–C angle of the acyl chains. At high FP23 content (Ri = 50), the

	Circular dichroism and conventional, 12C-Fourier transform infrared

	residues, isotope-enhanced FTIR spectroscopy was performed using
	a suite of FP peptides labeled with 13C-carbonyl at multiple sites.
	Combining these 13C-enhanced FTIR results with molecular simulations
	indicated the following model for FP in HFIP: [alpha]-helix (residues
	3-16) and random and [beta]-structures (residues 1-2 and residues
	17-23). Additional 13C-FTIR analysis indicated a similar conformation

	extracts, the central core of FP assumed an antiparallel [beta]-structure.
	FP at low loading in ghosts probably inserts deeply as an [alpha]-helix
	into the hydrophobic membrane bilayer, while at higher loading FP
	primarily associates with ghosts as an aqueous-accessible, [beta]-sheet.
	In future studies, 13C-FTIR spectroscopy may yield residue-specific
	conformations for other membrane-bound proteins or peptides, which

	aspiration data acquired in the low-pressure regime, reveals a significant
	correction from membrane stretching elasticity. The new description,
	which includes the full vesicle geometry and both the membrane bending
	and stretching elasticity, is used for the interpretation of micro-pipette
	aspiration experiments conducted on SOPC (stearoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl-choline)
	lipid vesicles in the fluid phase. The data analysis, which is extended
	by detailed image analysis and a fitting procedure based on Monte
	Carlo integration, gives an estimate of the bending modulus, that
	agrees with previously published results obtained by the use of shape
	fluctuation analysis of giant unilamellar vesicles. The obtained
	estimate of the area expansion modulus, is automatically corrected
	for contributions from residual thermal undulations and the equilibrium
	area of the vesicle is resolved.},

  abstract = {Micromechanical experiments on large lecithin bilayer vesicles as
	a function of temperature have demonstrated an essential feature
	of bilayer vesicles as closed systems: the bilayer can exist in a
	tension-free state (within the limits of experimental resolution,
	i.e., less than 10(-2) dyn/cm). Furthermore, because of the fixed
	internal volume, there is a critical temperature at which the vesicle
	becomes a tension-free sphere. Below this temperature, thermoelastic
	tension builds up in the membrane and the vesicle's internal pressure
	increases while the surface area remains constant. Above this temperature,
	the vesicle's surface area increases while the tension and internal
	pressure are negligible. Without mechanical support, the vesicles
	fragment into small vesicles because they have insufficient surface
	rigidity. In the upper temperature range we have measured the increase
	of surface area with temperature. These data established the thermal
	area expansivity to be 2.4 X 10(-3)/degrees C. At constant temperature,
	we used either pipet aspiration with suction pressures up to 10(4)
	dyn/cm2 or compression against a flat surface with forces up to 10(-2)
	dyn to produce area dilation of the vesicle surface on the order
	of 1%. The rate of increase of membrane tension with area dilation
	was calculated, which established the elastic area compressibility
	modulus to be 140 dyn/cm. The tension limit that produced lysis was
	observed to be 34 dyn/cm (equivalent to 23% area increase). The
	product of the elastic area compressibility modulus, the thermal
	area expansivity, and the temperature gives the reversible heat of
	expansion at constant temperature for the bilayer. This value is
	100 ergs/cm2 at 25 degrees C, or approximately 5 kcal/mol of lecithin.
	Similarly, the product of the thermal area expansivity multiplied
	by the area compressibility modulus determines the rate of increase
	of thermoelastic tension with decrease in temperature when the area
	is held constant, i.e., -0.34 dyn/cm/degrees C.},

	In membranes containing less than 30% cholesterol, the fusion domain
	forms an alpha helix, and in membranes containing more than 30% cholesterol,

	fusion domains is consistent with two different conformations in

	orientation and depth of the fusion domain in membranes. The fusion
	and membrane penetration activity of this domain in different membranes
	was measured by fluorescent lipid mixing and contents leakage assays.
	Interestingly, the fusion domain fuses membranes in both its helical
	and beta-structured forms. A high percentage of cholesterol, which
	promotes beta structure, promotes fusion, but a high concentration
	of acidic lipids, which in the absence of cholesterol leads to membrane
	insertion as an alpha helix, also promotes fusion. The results indicate

  title = {Phase Separation in Giant Vesicles},
  school = {Universit\"{a}t Potsdam},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {Giant vesicles may contain several spatial compartments formed by
	phase separation within their enclosed aqueous solution. This phenomenon
	might be related to molecular crowding, fractionation and protein
	sorting in cells. To elucidate this process we used two chemically
	dissimilar polymers, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran, encapsulated
	in giant vesicles. The dynamics of the phase separation of this polymer
	solution enclosed in vesicles is studied by concentration quench,
	i.e. exposing the vesicles to hypertonic solutions. The excess membrane
	area, produced by dehydration, can either form tubular structures
	(also known as tethers) or be utilized to perform morphological changes
	of the vesicle, depending on the interfacial tension between the
	coexisting phases and those between the membrane and the two phases.
	Membrane tube formation is coupled to the phase separation process.
	Apparently, the energy released from the phase separation is utilized
	to overcome the energy barrier for tube formation. The tubes may
	be absorbed at the interface to form a 2-demensional structure. The
	membrane stored in the form of tubes can be retracted under small
	tension perturbation.
	
	Furthermore, a wetting transition, which has been reported only in
	a few experimental systems, was discovered in this system. By increasing
	the polymer concentration, the PEG-rich phase changed from complete
	wetting to partial wetting of the membrane. If sufficient excess
	membrane area is available in the vesicle where both phases wet the
	membrane, one of the phases will bud off from the vesicle body, which
	leads to the separation of the two phases. This wetting-induced budding
	is governed by the surface energy and modulated by the membrane tension.
	This was demonstrated by micropipette aspiration experiments on vesicles
	encapsulating two phases. The budding of one phase can significantly
	decrease the surface energy by decreasing the contact area between
	the coexisting phases. The elasticity of the membrane allows it to
	adjust its tension automatically to balance the pulling force exerted
	by the interfacial tension of the two liquid phases at the three-phase
	contact line. The budding of the phase enriched with one polymer
	may be relevant to the selective protein transportation among lumens
	by means of vesicle in cells.},

	spanning the viral envelope, which attach to a membrane surface and
	induce fusion of the viral envelope to the cellular membrane. Influenza
	fusion protein (hemagglutinin) contains an amino-terminal segment
	critical to fusion, referred to as the fusion peptide. We show here
	that the native fusion peptide (wt-20) of hemagglutinin destabilizes
	membranes formed of 99% 1 -stearoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (SOPC).
	The first step in destabilization is rapid insertion of the peptide
	into the membrane, in which membrane area increases by as much as
	11% in just seconds. We visualized and quantified the area expansion
	by using optical video microscopy combined with micropipette aspiration.
	This rapid membrane area expansion is followed by the formation of
	membrane defects in the size range of 0.5 nm, and results in membrane
	rupture. Both the rate of area increase and maximum area increase
	are significantly higher at a pH near 5.0 compared to pH 7.0. These
	results suggest that enhanced membrane insertion of wt-20 and accompanying
	area expansion at pH 5.0 are responsible for the relatively greater
	lytic activity at this pH. We show that a deletion of the N-terminal
	glycine of wt-20 results in a lack of area expansion or membrane

	Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown an important
	role for the N-terminal gp41 domain in HIV-fusion, in which replacement
	of hydrophobic amino acids with polar residues inhibits viral infection
	and syncytia formation. Here, a synthetic peptide (FP; 23 amino acid
	residues 519-541) corresponding to the N-terminus of HIV-1 gp41,
	and also a FP analog (FP526L/R) with Arg replacing Leu-526, were
	prepared with solid phase techniques. The lipid mixing and leakage
	of resealed ghosts triggered by these peptides were examined with
	fluorescence quenching techniques. Peptide-induced aggregation of
	human erythrocytes was studied using Coulter counter sizing and scanning
	electron microscopy (SEM). Using resealed erythrocyte ghosts at physiologic
	pH, FP induces rapid lipid mixing between red cell membranes at doses
	previously shown to hemolyze intact cells. FP also causes leakage
	from resealed ghosts, and promotes the formation of multicelled aggregates
	with whole erythrocytes. Contrarily, similar FP526L/R concentrations
	did not induce red cell lysis, lipid mixing, leakage or aggregation.
	Since the fusogenic potency of FP and FP526L/R parallels earlier
	gp41 mutagenesis studies showing that substitution of Arg for Leu-526
	blocks fusion activity, these data suggest that the N-terminal gp41
	domain in intact HIV participates in fusion.},

  abstract = {Structural and functional studies were performed to assess the membrane
	actions of peptides based on HIV-1 glycoprotein 41,000 (gp41). Previous
	site-directed mutagenesis of gp41 has shown that amino acid changes
	in either the N-terminal fusion or N-leucine zipper region depressed
	viral infection and syncytium formation, while modifications in the
	C-leucine zipper domain both increased and decreased HIV fusion.
	Here, synthetic peptides were prepared corresponding to the N-terminal
	fusion region (FP-I; gp41 residues 519-541), the nearby N-leucine
	zipper domain (DP-107; gp41 residues 560-597), and the C-leucine
	zipper domain (DP-178; gp41 residues 645-680). With erythrocytes,
	FP-I or DP-107 induced dose-dependent hemolysis and promoted cell
	aggregation; FP-I was more hemolytic than DP-107, but each was equally
	effective in aggregating cells. DP-178 produced neither hemolysis
	nor aggregation, but blocked either FP-I- or DP-107-induced hemolysis
	and aggregation. Combined with previous nuclear magnetic resonance
	and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic results, circular dichroism
	(CD) spectroscopy showed that the Î±-helicity for these peptides
	in solution decreased in the order: DP-107 >> DP-178 > FP-I. CD analysis
	also indicated binding of DP-178 to either DP-107 or FP-I. Consequently,
	DP-178 may inhibit the membrane actions mediated by either FP-I or
	DP-107 through direct peptide interactions in solution. These peptide
	results suggest that the corresponding N-terminal fusion and N-leucine
	zipper regions participate in HIV infection, by promoting membrane
	perturbations underlying the merging of the viral envelope with the
	cell surface. Further, the C-leucine zipper domain in "prefusion"
	HIV may inhibit these membrane activities by interacting with the
	N-terminal fusion and N-leucine zipper domains in unactivated gp41.
	Last, exogenous DP-178 may bind to the N-terminal and N-leucine zipper
	domains of gp41 that become exposed on HIV stimulation, thereby preventing
	the fusogenic actions of these gp41 regions leading to infection.},

	The nonrandom ways that the molecules of lipids and proteins mix

	mixing is the separation of compositionally distinct phases. Any

	proteins and lipids between the coexisting phases, and thus would
	influence which proteins could be in contact, and whether a protein
	could find its target. Phase separation in a plasma membrane would
	also influence the binding of molecules from outside the cell to

	involving large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) composed of the negatively
	charged 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG). The peptide
	(HIVarg) induced fusion of POPG LUV as evidenced by (i) mixing of
	membrane lipids, (ii) mixing of aqueous vesicle contents, and (iii)
	an irreversible increase in vesicle size. Fusion could be induced
	only in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ or Mg2+,
	needed for induction of vesicle aggregation; the divalent cations
	by themselves did not induce any fusion. The rate constant of the
	fusion reaction, as determined by simulation of the process according
	to a kinetic model, increased dramatically with the peptide-to-lipid
	molar ratio, indicating that the peptide was the mediator of the
	process. In the absence of divalent cations, the HIVarg peptide induced
	leakage of small molecules due to formation of pores in the membrane
	of single vesicles. Final extents and kinetics of this leakage process
	could be simulated adequately by model calculations for peptide-to-lipid
	ratios ranging from 1:25 to 1:750. Experiments, in which the order
	of peptide and Ca2+ addition to the vesicles was varied, indicated
	that the peptide is likely to adopt two different structures, one
	in the absence of Ca2+, primarily supporting leakage by formation
	of pores in separate vesicles, and one in the presence of Ca2+, primarily
	supporting fusion. Once a final structure had been established, it
	persisted even upon addition or removal of Ca2+. From the infrared
	spectroscopy of the peptide at equilibrium with POPG vesicles it
	is concluded that the structure formed in the absence of Ca2+, supporting
	leakage, represents predominantly an $\alpha$-helix, whereas in the
	presence of Ca2+, i.e., under conditions supporting fusion, the peptide
	adopts mostly an extended antiparallel $\beta$-structure.},

	at 15°C, which gives the area expansivity [alpha]A = 0.0029/deg at
	30°C, and we show that this value is in excellent agreement with
	the polymer brush theory. The bilayer becomes thinner with increasing
	temperature; the contractivity of the hydrocarbon portion was [alpha]Dc = 0.0019/deg;
	the difference between [alpha]A and [alpha]Dc is consistent with
	the previously measured volume expansivity [alpha]Vc = 0.0010/deg.
	The bending modulus KC decreased as exp(455/T) with increasing T
	(K). Our area compressibility modulus KA decreased with increasing
	temperature by 5%, the same as the surface tension of dodecane/water,
	in agreement again with the polymer brush theory. Regarding interactions
	between bilayers, the compression modulus B as a function of interbilayer
	water spacing D'W was found to be nearly independent of temperature.
	The repulsive fluctuation pressure calculated from B and KC increased
	with temperature, and the Hamaker parameter for the van der Waals
	interaction was nearly independent of temperature; this explains
	why the fully hydrated water spacing, D'W, that we obtain from our
	structural results increases with temperature.},

  abstract = {The fusion peptide of HIV-1 gp41 is formed by the 16 N-terminal residues
	of the protein. This 16-amino acid peptide, in common with several
	other viral fusion peptides, caused a reduction in the bilayer to
	hexagonal phase transition temperature of dipalmitoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine
	(TH), suggesting its ability to promote negative curvature in membranes.
	Surprisingly, an elongated peptide corresponding to the 33 N-terminal
	amino acids raised TH, although it was more potent than the 16-amino
	acid fusion peptide in inducing lipid mixing with large unilamellar
	liposomes of 1:1:1 dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine/dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol.
	The 17-amino acid C-terminal fragment of the peptide can induce membrane
	fusion by itself, if it is anchored to a membrane by palmitoylation
	of the amino terminus, indicating that the additional 17 hydrophilic
	amino acids contribute to the fusogenic potency of the peptide. This
	is not solely a consequence of the palmitoylation, as a random peptide
	with the same amino acid composition with a palmitoyl anchor was
	less potent in promoting membrane fusion and palmitic acid itself
	had no fusogenic activity. The 16-amino acid N-terminal fusion peptide
	and the longer 33-amino acid peptide were labeled with NBD. Fluorescence
	binding studies indicate that both peptides bind to the membrane
	with similar affinities, indicating that the increased fusogenic
	activity of the longer peptide was not a consequence of a greater
	extent of membrane partitioning. We also determined the secondary
	structure of the peptides using FTIR spectroscopy. We find that the
	amino-terminal fusion peptide is inserted into the membrane as a
	beta-sheet and the 17 C-terminal amino acids lie on the surface of
	the membrane, adopting an alpha-helical conformation. It was further
	demonstrated with the use of rhodamine-labeled peptides that the
	33-amino acid peptide self-associated in the membrane while the 16-amino
	acid N-terminal peptide did not. Thus, the 16-amino acid N-terminal
	fusion peptide of HIV inserts into the membrane and, like other viral
	fusion peptides, lowers TH. In addition, the 17 consecutive amino
	acids enhance the fusogenic activity of the fusion peptide presumably
	by promoting its self-association.},

	The principal dimensions described are molecular areas and molecular
	lengths projected onto the hexagonal lattice. In contrast with large
	changes in average area at the polar and hydrocarbon ends of the
	molecule, a position near the polar group/hydrocarbon interface is
	one of constant molecular area. It remains constant both as the monolayers
	curl from changing water content and in the transition from one structure
	to the other. In the L-to-HII transition, the most obvious change
	in molecular length is a 25% decrease in the distance between aqueous
	cylinders, the interaxial direction. There is little change in the
	interstitial direction, the direction toward the interstice equidistant
	from three aqueous cylinders. As the hexagonal phase is dehydrated,
	a number of internal changes in molecular lengths are described.
	Increases in the interaxial direction are much larger than in the
	interstitial. Simultaneously however, hydrocarbon chain lengths decrease,
	and polar group lengths increase. It is likely that molecules move
	axially and the cylinders become longer with dehydration. These dimensions

	eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from

	(diC18:3), two with short saturated carbon chains (diC13:0, diC14:0),

	moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle
	surface area under very low tensions (0.0010.5mN/m), which is dominated
	by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli
	were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under
	high tensions (>0.5mN/m), which involve an increase in area per molecule
	and a smallbut importantcontribution from smoothing of residual
	thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (< ±10%)
	with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243mN/m.
	On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated
	chain PCs increased progressively with chain length from 0.56×1019
	J for diC13:0 to 1.2×1019 J for diC22:1. However, quite unexpectedly

	for all systems at low (15{degrees}C) and high (32-33{degrees}C)
	temperatures. The moduli for the single-component PC and binary phospholipid/CHOL

	to stretch than the single-component PC bilayers, the elastic response
	of vesicle bilayers made from the ternary phospholipid/CHOL mixtures
	showed an abrupt softening (discontinuity in slope), when immediately
	subjected to a steady ramp of tension at the low temperature (15{degrees}C).

	markedly with increase in temperature, as did the ternary SOPC/SM/CHOL

	shrinkage; and stage 3, rapid pore closure. They also show that lipid
	flow is kinetically limited by the values of both membrane and aqueous
	viscosity; therefore, pore evolution is affected by both viscosities.
	The theory predicts that for a giant liposome, tens of microns in
	radius, water viscosity dominates over the effects of membrane viscosity.
	The edge tension of a lipidic pore is calculated by using the theory
	to quantitatively account for pore kinetics in stage 3, rapid pore
	closing. This value of edge tension agrees with the value as standardly
	calculated from the stage of slow pore closure, stage 2. For small,

	fusion is the high resolution structure of fragments of the gp41
	fusion protein folded in a low energy core conformation. However,
	regions fundamental to fusion, like the fusion peptide (FP), have
	yet to be characterized in the context of the cognate protein regardless
	of its conformation. Based on conformation-specific monoclonal antibody
	recognition, we identified the polar region consecutive to the N36
	fragment as a stabilizer of trimeric coiled-coil assembly, thereby
	enhancing inhibitory potency. This tertiary organization is retained
	in the context of the hydrophobic FP (N70 fragment). Our data indicate
	that the N70 fragment recapitulates the expected organization of
	this region in the viral fusion intermediate (N-terminal half of
	the pre-hairpin intermediate (N-PHI)), which happens to be the prime
	target for fusion inhibitors. Regarding the low energy conformation,
	we show for the first time core formation in the context of the FP
	(N70 core). The α-helical and coiled-coil stabilizing polar region
	confers substantial thermal stability to the core, whereas the hydrophobic
	FP does not add further stability. For the two key fusion conformations,
	N-PHI and N70 core, we find that the FP adopts a nonhelical structure
	and directs higher order assembly (assembly of coiled coils in N-PHI
	and assembly of bundles in the N70 core). This supra-molecular organization
	of coiled coils or folded cores is seen only in the context of the
	FP. This study is the first to characterize the FP region in the
	context of the folded core and provides a basic understanding of
	the role of the elusive FP for key gp41 fusion conformations.},

  abstract = {A tutorial review of the theory of curvature elasticity of thin films

	on the role of special surfaces of curvature to show how such surfaces
	can be defined to eliminate either the coupling of the compressibility
	and bending terms (neutral surface) or the saddle-splay (Gaussian
	curvature) modulus. Next, we consider phenomenological models for
	curvature elasticity and discuss the coupling of the curvature degrees
	of freedom with other properties of the system such as the packing
	area and the number of molecules at the interface. The pressure distribution
	in the film is related to the bending moduli. We then connect the
	elastic moduli to the physical properties of both solid and liquid
	thin films with a detailed discussion of the role of solid elasticity
	(including defects), electrostatic interactions (applicable to polar
	head groups and chain packing (using a block copolymer model of amphiphilic
	molecules). Finally, we demonstrate the effects of fluctuations and
	inhomogeneities in these systems in a discussion of the role of thermal
	undulations in renormalizing the bending moduli and of mixtures of
	amphiphiles of different chain lengths in fluid films. The article
	is concluded with a brief review of experimental characterizations

	The peptides of the first family starting from the C-terminal Gly-532
	of gp160 (BRU isolate) were assembled in a stepwise manner to N-terminus
	of gp41(A1a-517). These hydrophobic peptides, containing 10-16 amino

	through planar lipid membranes, and the longest 15-16 a.a. peptides
	lysed the liposomes. Peptides of the second family beginning from
	the C-terminal Arg-538 and continuing to Val-510 contained several
	hydrophilic amino acid residues. These 15-22 a.a. peptides also increased
	the conductance of planar lipid bilayers and lysed liposomes. The
	degree of liposome lysis depended upon peptide length and concentration.
	The attachment of gp120 C-terminal amino acid or peptides to N-terminus

	large spherical aggregates about 0.5-0.7 μm in diameter consisting
	of long filaments approximately 5 nm in diameter. Other tested peptides
	could generate only short strings. Thus, the effects of fusion peptides

	and does not require dilution. Comparison of results obtained with
	lipid species of varying degrees of unsaturation incorporated into
	either SUV or LUV suggested that acyl chain unsaturation and high
	membrane curvature combine to favor fusion of pure phosphatidylcholine
	membranes. There was a clear correlation between the fluorescence
	lifetime or the order parameter of the membrane probe 1-(4-trimethylammonium)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene
	(TMA-DPH) in different membranes and the concentration of PEG needed
	to induce fusion of these membranes. However, the ratios of TMA-DPH
	lifetimes measured in D2O versus H2O buffers were the same for different
	lipid species, indicating that probe penetration was not very different
	for different lipid species. The results suggest that the combined
	effect of high membrane curvature and extensive chain unsaturation
	is an enhanced rate of lipid motion in the upper region of the bilayer,
	reflective of decreased packing density in the outer leaflet of unsaturated
	SUV bilayers, probably allowing for enhanced water penetration leading
	to an enhanced probability of fusion.},

	(FP) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) with model membranes
	in order to elucidate how FP leads to fusion of HIV and T-cell membranes.
	FP constructs were (i) wild-type FP23 (23 N-terminal amino acids
	of gp41), (ii) water-soluble monomeric FP that adds six lysines on
	the C-terminus of FP23 (FPwsm), and (iii) the C-terminus covalently
	linked trimeric version (FPtri) of FPwsm. Model membranes were (i)
	LM3 (a T-cell mimic), (ii) 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,
	(iii) 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/30�mol% cholesterol,
	(iv) 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and (v) 1,2-dierucoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/30�mol%
	cholesterol. Diffuse synchrotron low-angle x-ray scattering from
	fully hydrated samples, supplemented by volumetric data, showed that
	FP23 and FPtri penetrate into the hydrocarbon region and cause membranes
	to thin. Depth of penetration appears to depend upon a complex combination
	of factors including bilayer thickness, presence of cholesterol,
	and electrostatics. X-ray data showed an increase in curvature in
	hexagonal phase 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, which
	further indicates that FP23 penetrates into the hydrocarbon region
	rather than residing in the interfacial headgroup region. Low-angle
	x-ray scattering data also yielded the bending modulus KC, a measure
	of membrane stiffness, and wide-angle x-ray scattering yielded the
	Sxray orientational order parameter. Both FP23 and FPtri decreased
	KC and Sxray considerably, while the weak effect of FPwsm suggests
	that it did not partition strongly into LM3 model membranes. Our
	results are consistent with the HIV FP disordering and softening
	the T-cell membrane, thereby lowering the activation energy for viral

  abstract = {A crucial step in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is
	fusion between the viral envelope and the T-cell membrane, which
	must involve intermediate membrane states with high curvature. Our
	main result from diffuse x-ray scattering is that the bending modulus
	KC is greatly reduced upon addition of the HIV fusion peptide FP-23
	to lipid bilayers. A smaller bending modulus reduces the free energy
	barriers required to achieve and pass through the highly curved intermediate
	states and thereby facilitates fusion and HIV infection. The reduction
	in KC is by a factor of 13 for the thicker, stiffer 1,2-sn-dierucoylphosphatidylcholine
	bilayers and by a factor of 3 for 1,2-sn-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
	bilayers. The reduction in KC decays exponentially with concentration
	of FP-23, and the 1/e concentration is <1mol % peptide/lipid, which
	is well within the physiological range for a fusion site. A secondary
	result is, when FP-23 is added to the samples which consist of stacks
	of membranes, that the distance between membranes increases and eventually
	becomes infinite at full hydration (unbinding); we attribute this
	both to electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged arginine
	in the FP-23 and to an increase in the repulsive fluctuation interaction
	brought about by the smaller KC. Although this latter interaction
	works against membrane fusion, our results show that the energy that
	it requires of the fusion protein machinery to bring the HIV envelope
	membrane and the target T-cell membrane into close contact is negligible.},

	fusion. However, previous investigations on the system of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
	(DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) did not reveal
	intermediate phases between the Lα and HII phases. Recently, we found
	a rhombohedral phase of diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine between its
	Lα and HII phases using substrate-supported samples. Here we report
	the observation of two new phases in the DOPC−DOPE system:  a rhombohedral
	phase and a distorted hexagonal phase. The rhombohedral phase confirms
	the stalk hypothesis for the Lα−HII transition, but the phase of
	stable stalks exists only for a certain range of spontaneous curvature.
	The distorted hexagonal phase exists only in a lipid mixture. It
	implies that lipids may demix to adjust its local spontaneous curvature
	in order to achieve energy minimum under stress.},

  abstract = {The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fusion peptide (HFP) is the
	N-terminal apolar region of the HIV gp41 fusion protein and interacts
	with target cell membranes and promotes membrane fusion. The free
	peptide catalyzes vesicle fusion at least to the lipid mixing stage
	and serves as a useful model fusion system. For gp41 constructs which
	lack the HFP, high-resolution structures show trimeric protein and
	suggest that at least three HFPs interact with the membrane with
	their C-termini in close proximity. In addition, previous studies
	have demonstrated that HFPs which are cross-linked at their C-termini
	to form trimers (HFPtr) catalyze fusion at a rate which is 15-40
	times greater than that of non-cross-linked HFP. In the present study,
	the structure of membrane-associated HFPtr was probed with solid-state
	nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. Chemical shift and intramolecular
	(13)CO-(15)N distance measurements show that the conformation of
	the Leu-7 to Phe-11 region of HFPtr has predominant helical conformation
	in membranes without cholesterol and beta strand conformation in
	membranes containing approximately 30 mol % cholesterol. Interstrand
	(13)CO-(13)CO and (13)CO-(15)N distance measurements were not consistent
	with an in-register parallel strand arrangement but were consistent
	with either (1) parallel arrangement with adjacent strands two residues
	out-of-register or (2) antiparallel arrangement with adjacent strand
	crossing between Phe-8 and Leu-9. Arrangement 1 could support the
	rapid fusion rate of HFPtr because of placement of the apolar N-terminal
	regions of all strands on the same side of the oligomer while arrangement
	2 could support the assembly of multiple fusion protein trimers.},
