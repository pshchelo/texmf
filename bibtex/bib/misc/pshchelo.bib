  abstract = {The Ca2+-triggered merger of two apposed membranes is the defining
	step of regulated exocytosis. CHOL is required at critical levels
	in secretory vesicle membranes to enable efficient, native membrane
	fusion: CHOL-sphingomyelin enriched microdomains organize the site
	and regulate fusion efficiency, and CHOL directly supports the capacity
	for membrane merger by virtue of its negative spontaneous curvature.
	Specific, structurally dissimilar lipids substitute for CHOL in supporting
	the ability of vesicles to fuse: diacylglycerol, ±T, and phosphatidylethanolamine
	support triggered fusion in CHOL-depleted vesicles, and this correlates
	quantitatively with the amount of curvature each imparts to the membrane.
	Lipids of lesser negative curvature than cholesterol do not support
	fusion. The fundamental mechanism of regulated bilayer merger requires
	not only a defined amount of membrane-negative curvature, but this
	curvature must be provided by molecules having a specific, critical
	spontaneous curvature. Such a local lipid composition is energetically
	favorable, ensuring the necessary spontaneous lipid rearrangements
	that must occur during native membrane fusionCa2+-triggered fusion
	pore formation and expansion. Thus, different fusion sites or vesicle
	types can use specific alternate lipidic components, or combinations
	thereof, to facilitate and modulate the fusion pore.},

	spanning the viral envelope, which attach to a membrane surface and
	induce fusion of the viral envelope to the cellular membrane. Influenza
	fusion protein (hemagglutinin) contains an amino-terminal segment
	critical to fusion, referred to as the fusion peptide. We show here
	that the native fusion peptide (wt-20) of hemagglutinin destabilizes
	membranes formed of 99% 1 -stearoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (SOPC).
	The first step in destabilization is rapid insertion of the peptide
	into the membrane, in which membrane area increases by as much as
	11% in just seconds. We visualized and quantified the area expansion
	by using optical video microscopy combined with micropipette aspiration.
	This rapid membrane area expansion is followed by the formation of
	membrane defects in the size range of 0.5 nm, and results in membrane
	rupture. Both the rate of area increase and maximum area increase
	are significantly higher at a pH near 5.0 compared to pH 7.0. These

	area expansion at pH 5.0 are responsible for the relatively greater
	lytic activity at this pH. We show that a deletion of the N-terminal
	glycine of wt-20 results in a lack of area expansion or membrane
	perturbation at pH 5.0.},

	permeability rose to ~50 {micro}m/s for C18:0/2, then strikingly
	to ~90 {micro}m/s for diC18:2 and ~150 {micro}m/s for diC18:3. The
	measurements of water permeability were found to scale exponentially
	with the reduced temperatures reported for these lipids in the literature.
	The correlation supports the concept that increase in free volume
	acquired in thermal expansion above the main gel-liquid crystal transition
	of a bilayer is a major factor in water transport. Taken together,
	the prominent changes in lysis tension and water permeability indicate
	that major changes occur in chain packing and cohesive interactions
	when two or more cis-double bonds alternate with saturated bonds
	along a chain.},

  abstract = {The fluctuation spectrum of giant unilamellar vesicles is measured
	using a high-resolution contour detection technique. An analysis
	at higher q vectors than previously achievable is now possible due
	to technical improvements of the experimental setup and of the detection
	algorithm. The global fluctuation spectrum is directly fitted to
	deduce the membrane tension and the bending modulus of lipid membranes.
	Moreover, we show that the planar analysis of fluctuations is valid
	for spherical objects, even at low wave vectors. Corrections due
	to the integration time of the video camera and to the section of
	a 3D object by the observation plane are introduced. A precise calculation
	of the error bars has been done in order to provide reliable error
	estimate. Eventually, using this technique, we have measured bending
	moduli for EPC, SOPC and SOPC: CHOL membranes confirming previously
	published values. An interesting application of this technique can
	be the measurement of the fluctuation spectra for non-equilibrium
	membranes, such as ''active membranes''.},

  abstract = {Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to
	measure both elastic bending kc and area stretch KA moduli of fluid-phase
	phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. Twelve diacyl PCs were chosen:
	eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from
	one double bond (C18:1/0, C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid
	(diC18:3), two with short saturated carbon chains (diC13:0, diC14:0),
	and two with long unsaturated carbon chains (diC20:4, diC22:1). Bending
	moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle
	surface area under very low tensions (0.0010.5mN/m), which is dominated
	by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli
	were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under
	high tensions (>0.5mN/m), which involve an increase in area per molecule
	and a smallbut importantcontribution from smoothing of residual
	thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (< ±10%)
	with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243mN/m.
	On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated
	chain PCs increased progressively with chain length from 0.56×1019
	J for diC13:0 to 1.2×1019 J for diC22:1. However, quite unexpectedly
	for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to <0.4×1019
	J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain (C18:0/2,
	diC18:2, diC18:3, diC20:4). Given nearly constant area stretch moduli,
	the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation
	implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis,
	peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses hpp of bilayers were obtained
	from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative
	humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances
	hpp increased smoothly from diC13:0 to diC22:1 as expected. Moreover,
	the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer
	brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio
	(kc/KA)1/2=(hppho)/24, where ho H 1nm accounts for separation of
	the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However,
	the elastic ratios and thicknesses for diC18:2, diC18:3, and diC20:4
	fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that
	poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible
	than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.},

  abstract = {Bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingomyelin (SM),
	and cholesterol (CHOL) are commonly used as systems to model the
	raft-lipid domain structure believed to compartmentalize particular
	cell membrane proteins. In this work, micropipette aspiration of
	giant unilamellar vesicles was used to test the elasticities, water
	permeabilities, and rupture tensions of single-component PC, binary
	1:1 PC/CHOL, and 1:1 SM/CHOL, and ternary 1:1:1 PC/SM/CHOL bilayers,
	one set of measurements with dioleoyl PC (DOPC; C18:1/C18:1 PC) and
	the other with stearoyloleoyl PC (SOPC; C18:0/C18:1 PC). Defining
	the elastic moduli (KA), the initial slopes of the increase in tension
	({sigma}) versus stretch in lipid surface area ({alpha}e) were determined
	for all systems at low (15{degrees}C) and high (32-33{degrees}C)
	temperatures. The moduli for the single-component PC and binary phospholipid/CHOL
	bilayers followed a descending hierarchy of stretch resistance with
	SM/CHOL > SOPC/CHOL > DOPC/CHOL > PC. Although much more resistant
	to stretch than the single-component PC bilayers, the elastic response
	of vesicle bilayers made from the ternary phospholipid/CHOL mixtures
	showed an abrupt softening (discontinuity in slope), when immediately
	subjected to a steady ramp of tension at the low temperature (15{degrees}C).
	However, the discontinuities in elastic stretch resistance at low
	temperature vanished when the bilayers were held at [~]1 mN/m prestress
	for long times before a tension ramp and when tested at the higher
	temperature 32-33{degrees}C. The elastic moduli of single-component
	PC and DOPC/CHOL bilayers changed very little with temperature, whereas
	the moduli of the binary SOPC/CHOL and SM/CHOL bilayers diminished
	markedly with increase in temperature, as did the ternary SOPC/SM/CHOL
	system. For all systems, increasing temperature increased the water
	permeability but decreased rupture tension. Concomitantly, the measurements
	of permeability exhibited a prominent correlation with the rupture
	tension across all the systems. Together, these micromechanical tests
	of binary and ternary phospholipid/CHOL bilayers demonstrate that
	PC hydrocarbon chain unsaturation and temperature are major determinants
	of the mechanical and permeation properties of membranes composed
	of raft microdomain-forming lipids.},

	function of the distance from the centre, and is especially suitable
	for tracking endogeneous particles in the cell, imaged with bright
	field, phase contrast or fluorescence optical microscopy. Furthermore,

	and allows significant freedom in their shape. The algorithm is evaluated
	using the quantitative measures of accuracy and precision of previous
	authors, using simulated images at variable signal-to-noise ratios.
	To these we add new tests: the error due to a non-uniform background,
	and the error due to two particles approaching each other. Finally
	the tracking of particles in real cell images is demonstrated. The

	We have developed a noncontact nanoscale method to apply quantified

	(0.1-150 kPa) through a pipette, while the pipette-sample separation

	distance feedback. This prevents any surface contact, or contamination
	of the pipette, allowing repeated measurements. We show that we can

	pressure, and hence measure the nanomechanical properties of the
	cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton in a variety of cells
	(erythrocytes, epithelium, cardiomyocytes and neurons). Because the

	to relate the mechanical properties to the local cell topography.

  abstract = {A crucial step in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is
	fusion between the viral envelope and the T-cell membrane, which
	must involve intermediate membrane states with high curvature. Our
	main result from diffuse x-ray scattering is that the bending modulus
	KC is greatly reduced upon addition of the HIV fusion peptide FP-23
	to lipid bilayers. A smaller bending modulus reduces the free energy
	barriers required to achieve and pass through the highly curved intermediate
	states and thereby facilitates fusion and HIV infection. The reduction
	in KC is by a factor of 13 for the thicker, stiffer 1,2-sn-dierucoylphosphatidylcholine
	bilayers and by a factor of 3 for 1,2-sn-dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
	bilayers. The reduction in KC decays exponentially with concentration
	of FP-23, and the 1/e concentration is <1mol % peptide/lipid, which
	is well within the physiological range for a fusion site. A secondary
	result is, when FP-23 is added to the samples which consist of stacks
	of membranes, that the distance between membranes increases and eventually
	becomes infinite at full hydration (unbinding); we attribute this
	both to electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged arginine
	in the FP-23 and to an increase in the repulsive fluctuation interaction
	brought about by the smaller KC. Although this latter interaction
	works against membrane fusion, our results show that the energy that
	it requires of the fusion protein machinery to bring the HIV envelope
	membrane and the target T-cell membrane into close contact is negligible.},
