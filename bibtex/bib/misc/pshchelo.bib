  abstract = {Liposome formation and lipid swelling on platinum electrodes in distilled
	water and water solutions in d.c. electrical fields have been investigated
	for different amounts of a negatively charged lipid (mixture from
	71% PC, 21.5% PE and 7.5% PS), and a neutral lipid (DMPC). Negatively
	charged lipids do not form liposomes without field when the thickness
	of the dried lipid layer is of the order or less than that corresponding
	to 90 bilayers. The rate and extent of swelling of layers thicker
	than 90 bilayers is largest on the cathode, smaller without fields
	and smallest on the anode. The theory, based on the assumption that
	osmotic and electrostatic forces drive lipid swelling and liposome
	formation, is in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental
	data; in particular, it gives the observed linear dependence of the
	rate of swelling on the inverse lipid layer thickness. To induce
	liposome formation for layers thinner than 90 bilayers it was necessary
	to apply a negative potential which is proportional to the logarithm
	of the inversed layer thickness. The characteristic critical potential
	is proportional to RTk/F; R being the gas constant, Tk the absolute
	temperature and F the Faraday constant. This indicates that redistribution
	of counterions may be the cause which increases the repulsive electrostatic
	intermembrane forces to overcome van der Waals attraction. For thicknesses
	below 10 bilayers, formation of very thin-walled liposomes of narrow
	size distribution and mean diameter of the order of 30 m was observed.
	These liposomes grow in size before detachment and a formula for
	the kinetics of growth has been derived, which is in very good agreement
	with the experimental data. The effects of d.c. fields on DMPC swelling
	are smaller and lead to formation of liposome-like structures of
	different appearence. Bilayer separation and bending are prerequisites
	for liposome formation from hydrating lipids. Therefore, a possible
	molecular mechanism is that membranes should be destabilized to bend
	and fuse to form liposomes. This requires the right proportion between
	structured regions, in the form of bilayers, and defects and/or non-bilayer
	structures, and in many cases external constraints, in particular,
	electrical fields.},

	used for studying protein/lipid interactions due to their size (similar
	to that of cells) and to their ease of observation by light microscopy
	techniques. Biophysicists have begun to complexify GUVs to investigate
	lipid/protein interactions. In particular, composite GUVs have been
	designed that incorporate lipids that play important physiological
	roles in cellulo, such as phosphoinositides and among those the most
	abundant one, phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PIP2). Fluorescent
	lipids are often used as tracers to observe GUV membranes by microscopy
	but they can not bring quantitative information about the insertion

	to prove the effective incorporation of PIP2 as well as that of phosphatidylserine
	in the membrane of GUVs prepared by electroformation and to follow
	the stability of PIP2-containing GUVs. Using confocal microscopy,

	effect, which is emphasized when tertiary antibodies are used in
	addition to secondary ones to enhance the size of the detection complex,
	is artifactual. We showed that divalent ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) can
	induce aggregation of PIP2 in the membrane depending on their concentration.
	Finally, the interaction of ezrin with PIP2-containing GUVs was investigated.
	Using either labeled ezrin and unlabeled GUVs or both labeled ezrin
	and GUVs, we showed that clusters of PIP2 and proteins are formed.},

	step of regulated exocytosis. CHOL is required at critical levels
	in secretory vesicle membranes to enable efficient, native membrane
	fusion: CHOL-sphingomyelin enriched microdomains organize the site
	and regulate fusion efficiency, and CHOL directly supports the capacity
	for membrane merger by virtue of its negative spontaneous curvature.
	Specific, structurally dissimilar lipids substitute for CHOL in supporting
	the ability of vesicles to fuse: diacylglycerol, ±T, and phosphatidylethanolamine
	support triggered fusion in CHOL-depleted vesicles, and this correlates
	quantitatively with the amount of curvature each imparts to the membrane.
	Lipids of lesser negative curvature than cholesterol do not support
	fusion. The fundamental mechanism of regulated bilayer merger requires
	not only a defined amount of membrane-negative curvature, but this
	curvature must be provided by molecules having a specific, critical
	spontaneous curvature. Such a local lipid composition is energetically
	favorable, ensuring the necessary spontaneous lipid rearrangements
	that must occur during native membrane fusionCa2+-triggered fusion
	pore formation and expansion. Thus, different fusion sites or vesicle
	types can use specific alternate lipidic components, or combinations

	becomes a tension-free sphere. Below this temperature, thermoelastic
	tension builds up in the membrane and the vesicle's internal pressure
	increases while the surface area remains constant. Above this temperature,
	the vesicle's surface area increases while the tension and internal
	pressure are negligible. Without mechanical support, the vesicles
	fragment into small vesicles because they have insufficient surface
	rigidity. In the upper temperature range we have measured the increase
	of surface area with temperature. These data established the thermal
	area expansivity to be 2.4 X 10(-3)/degrees C. At constant temperature,
	we used either pipet aspiration with suction pressures up to 10(4)
	dyn/cm2 or compression against a flat surface with forces up to 10(-2)
	dyn to produce area dilation of the vesicle surface on the order
	of 1%. The rate of increase of membrane tension with area dilation
	was calculated, which established the elastic area compressibility
	modulus to be 140 dyn/cm. The tension limit that produced lysis was
	observed to be 34 dyn/cm (equivalent to 23% area increase). The
	product of the elastic area compressibility modulus, the thermal
	area expansivity, and the temperature gives the reversible heat of
	expansion at constant temperature for the bilayer. This value is
	100 ergs/cm2 at 25 degrees C, or approximately 5 kcal/mol of lecithin.
	Similarly, the product of the thermal area expansivity multiplied
	by the area compressibility modulus determines the rate of increase
	of thermoelastic tension with decrease in temperature when the area
	is held constant, i.e., -0.34 dyn/cm/degrees C.},

	spanning the viral envelope, which attach to a membrane surface and
	induce fusion of the viral envelope to the cellular membrane. Influenza
	fusion protein (hemagglutinin) contains an amino-terminal segment
	critical to fusion, referred to as the fusion peptide. We show here
	that the native fusion peptide (wt-20) of hemagglutinin destabilizes
	membranes formed of 99% 1 -stearoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (SOPC).
	The first step in destabilization is rapid insertion of the peptide
	into the membrane, in which membrane area increases by as much as
	11% in just seconds. We visualized and quantified the area expansion
	by using optical video microscopy combined with micropipette aspiration.
	This rapid membrane area expansion is followed by the formation of
	membrane defects in the size range of 0.5 nm, and results in membrane
	rupture. Both the rate of area increase and maximum area increase
	are significantly higher at a pH near 5.0 compared to pH 7.0. These
	results suggest that enhanced membrane insertion of wt-20 and accompanying
	area expansion at pH 5.0 are responsible for the relatively greater
	lytic activity at this pH. We show that a deletion of the N-terminal
	glycine of wt-20 results in a lack of area expansion or membrane
	perturbation at pH 5.0.},

	of hydrophobic amino acids with polar residues inhibits viral infection
	and syncytia formation. Here, a synthetic peptide (FP; 23 amino acid

	previously shown to hemolyze intact cells. FP also causes leakage
	from resealed ghosts, and promotes the formation of multicelled aggregates
	with whole erythrocytes. Contrarily, similar FP526L/R concentrations
	did not induce red cell lysis, lipid mixing, leakage or aggregation.
	Since the fusogenic potency of FP and FP526L/R parallels earlier
	gp41 mutagenesis studies showing that substitution of Arg for Leu-526
	blocks fusion activity, these data suggest that the N-terminal gp41

	other viral fusion peptides, caused a reduction in the bilayer to
	hexagonal phase transition temperature of dipalmitoleoylphosphatidylethanolamine
	(TH), suggesting its ability to promote negative curvature in membranes.
	Surprisingly, an elongated peptide corresponding to the 33 N-terminal
	amino acids raised TH, although it was more potent than the 16-amino
	acid fusion peptide in inducing lipid mixing with large unilamellar
	liposomes of 1:1:1 dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine/dioleoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol.
	The 17-amino acid C-terminal fragment of the peptide can induce membrane
	fusion by itself, if it is anchored to a membrane by palmitoylation
	of the amino terminus, indicating that the additional 17 hydrophilic
	amino acids contribute to the fusogenic potency of the peptide. This
	is not solely a consequence of the palmitoylation, as a random peptide
	with the same amino acid composition with a palmitoyl anchor was
	less potent in promoting membrane fusion and palmitic acid itself
	had no fusogenic activity. The 16-amino acid N-terminal fusion peptide
	and the longer 33-amino acid peptide were labeled with NBD. Fluorescence
	binding studies indicate that both peptides bind to the membrane
	with similar affinities, indicating that the increased fusogenic
	activity of the longer peptide was not a consequence of a greater
	extent of membrane partitioning. We also determined the secondary
	structure of the peptides using FTIR spectroscopy. We find that the
	amino-terminal fusion peptide is inserted into the membrane as a
	beta-sheet and the 17 C-terminal amino acids lie on the surface of
	the membrane, adopting an alpha-helical conformation. It was further

  abstract = {Micropipette pressurization of giant bilayer vesicles was used to
	measure both elastic bending kc and area stretch KA moduli of fluid-phase
	phosphatidylcholine (PC) membranes. Twelve diacyl PCs were chosen:
	eight with two 18 carbon chains and degrees of unsaturation from
	one double bond (C18:1/0, C18:0/1) to six double bonds per lipid
	(diC18:3), two with short saturated carbon chains (diC13:0, diC14:0),
	and two with long unsaturated carbon chains (diC20:4, diC22:1). Bending
	moduli were derived from measurements of apparent expansion in vesicle
	surface area under very low tensions (0.0010.5mN/m), which is dominated
	by smoothing of thermal bending undulations. Area stretch moduli
	were obtained from measurements of vesicle surface expansion under
	high tensions (>0.5mN/m), which involve an increase in area per molecule
	and a smallbut importantcontribution from smoothing of residual
	thermal undulations. The direct stretch moduli varied little (< ±10%)
	with either chain unsaturation or length about a mean of 243mN/m.
	On the other hand, the bending moduli of saturated/monounsaturated
	chain PCs increased progressively with chain length from 0.56×1019
	J for diC13:0 to 1.2×1019 J for diC22:1. However, quite unexpectedly
	for longer chains, the bending moduli dropped precipitously to <0.4×1019
	J when two or more cis double bonds were present in a chain (C18:0/2,
	diC18:2, diC18:3, diC20:4). Given nearly constant area stretch moduli,
	the variations in bending rigidity with chain length and polyunsaturation
	implied significant variations in thickness. To test this hypothesis,
	peak-to-peak headgroup thicknesses hpp of bilayers were obtained
	from x-ray diffraction of multibilayer arrays at controlled relative
	humidities. For saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers, the distances

	the distances and elastic properties correlated well with a polymer
	brush model of the bilayer that specifies that the elastic ratio
	(kc/KA)1/2=(hppho)/24, where ho H 1nm accounts for separation of
	the headgroup peaks from the deformable hydrocarbon region. However,
	the elastic ratios and thicknesses for diC18:2, diC18:3, and diC20:4
	fell into a distinct group below the correlation, which showed that
	poly-cis unsaturated chain bilayers are thinner and more flexible
	than saturated/monounsaturated chain bilayers.},

	to lipid bilayers. A smaller bending modulus reduces the free energy
	barriers required to achieve and pass through the highly curved intermediate

	result is, when FP-23 is added to the samples which consist of stacks

	becomes infinite at full hydration (unbinding); we attribute this
	both to electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged arginine

	brought about by the smaller KC. Although this latter interaction
	works against membrane fusion, our results show that the energy that

  abstract = {We applied two independent methods to measure the bending elasticity
	of SOPC lipid membranes in the presence of different sucrose concentrations
	in the aqueous phase. The micropipette technique was used to study
	the membrane bending rigidity in the concentration range of (0.11–0.30)
	mol/l of sucrose, while for sucrose concentrations 0 mol/l and 0.05 mol/l
	the thermal fluctuation analysis of quasi-spherical vesicles was
	applied. Both methods revealed a strong reduction of the bending
	elastic modulus, when sucrose is present in the water. Using micromanipulation
	of emulsion droplets, we investigated the sucrose influence on the
	stretching elasticity of SOPC lipid monolayers at the oil-water interface.
	Our results showed an almost two-fold reduction of the stretching
	elasticity modulus of the lipid monolayer in the presence of 0.18 mol/l
	of sucrose in the aqueous phase. The experimental results, reported
	here, reveal a strong influence of sugar molecules on the elasticity
	of lipid mono- and bilayers.},

  abstract = {To define the role of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
	envelope proteins in virus infection, a series of peptides were synthesized
	based on various regions of the HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41.
	One of these peptides, DP-178, corresponding to a region predictive
	of α-helical secondary structure (residues 643-678 of the HIV-1LAI
	isolate), has been identified as a potent antiviral agent. This peptide
	consistently blocked 100% of virus-mediated cell-cell fusion at <5
	ng/ml (IC90 ≈ 1.5 ng/ml) and gave an ≈ 10 times reduction in infectious
	titer of cell-free virus at ≈ 80 ng/ml. The inhibitory activity was
	observed at peptide concentrations ≈104 to 105 times lower than those
	at which cytotoxicity and cytostasis were detected. Peptide-mediated
	inhibition is HIV-1 specific in that ≈102 to 103 times more peptide
	was required for inhibition of a human immunodeficiency virus type
	2 isolate. Further experiments showed that DP-178 exhibited antiviral
	activity against both prototypic and primary HIV-1 isolates. As shown
	by PCR analysis of newly synthesized proviral DNA, DP-178 blocks
	an early step in the virus life cycle prior to reverse transcription.
	Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms by which DP-178 may exert
	its inhibitory activity.},
