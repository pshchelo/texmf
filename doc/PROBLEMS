This file explains how to solve some known problems occuring in PSCyr-0.4.

Q. dvips produces an error message "First number not found. ERROR in
   encoding vector in <...>".
A. Your dvips file is old.  Either upgrade to newer dvips (version 5.86
   or higher) or use your dvips with the -j0 option.

Q. Acrobat 4 issues the message "CRBUTR+AntiquaPSCyr-Bold contains a bad
   /BBox".
A. You have an old version of pdftex.  Upgrade to a newer one (current
   stable version is 0.14f).

Q. Acrobat 4 doesn't show the CourierPSMT-Italic font in PDF files
   produced by pdflatex.
A. Upgrade the fonts to PSCyr-0.4b or prepare your PDF file from PostScript
   using gs6** (tex->dvi->ps->pdf).

Q. Acrobat 4 issues the message "Unable to extract the embedded font
   'AACDDA+CourierPSMT-Italic'. Some characters may not display or print
   correctly" when reading PDF files produced by pdflatex.
A. Upgrade the fonts to PSCyr-0.4b or prepare your PDF file from PostScript
   using gs6** (tex->dvi->ps->pdf).

Q. TeX issues a warning like "Font shape `OMS/faq/m/n` undefined ..."
A. Ignore this message.  PSCyr font collection doesn't contain math and
   symbol characters that enter OMS, OML, OMX, and TS1 encoding tables.
   The required characters are taken from other fonts (like Computer Modern).

Q. TeX produces a wrong position of the ring in \AA symbol in all Russian
   fonts.
A. Comment the command "\DeclareTextCompositeCommand ..." in t2aenc.def file.
