NAME

    PSCYR package, version 0.3 from  September 10, 1998. 

DESCRIPTION 
   
    Collection of files providing support for Cyrillic 
    PostScript Fonts in LaTeX documents. 

    Final output is PostScript or PDF. 

DISTRIBUTION 

The distribution is split into two parts.

  * The first part (PsCyr-type1-03.tar.gz) 
    contains the files that are unlikely to change in 
    future releases:

    - font sources in Type 1 format;
    - Adobe font metrics.

    Fonts: Academy, Advertisement, Antiqua, College, Handbook,
       Lazurski, Magazine, Textbook, ArialCyrMT, CourierCyrPS,
       ERKurierKOI8RRegular, TimesNRCyrMT.

  * The second part (PsCyr-tex-03.tar.gz) 
    contains the files that are liable to modifications:
   
    - installation instructions (this file);
    - TeX font metrics;
    - font definitions; 
    - encodings; 
    - font mappings for DVIPS and pdfTeX
    - style and examples of usage;
    - scripts for generation of TeX font metrics and the map
      file.


INSTALLATION

  * Requirements

    - T2 package for LaTeX. This package is available from  
      CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported/t2. 
      It provides support for T2* Cyrillic TeX encodings. 
    - Dvips or pdf-LaTeX installed. Ghostscript (ghostview) or
      Acrobat Reader to visualize and print PostScript/PDF
      documents.


  * Procedure

     - Unpack the distribution: PsCyr-type1-[version].tar.gz,
                                PsCyr-tex-[version].tar.gz.

    TeX:
 
    - Copy the .tfm and .fd files to where TeX can find them.
    - Modify if necessary the TFMFONTS and TEXINPUTS environment
      variables.


    DVIPS:

    - Copy the .pfb and .enc files to where DVIPS headers reside.
    - Modify if necessary the DVIPSHEADERS environment variable. 
    - Add the string
         p +pscyr.map
      to the global configuration file config.ps, or
      to .dvipsrc in your home directory (UNIX).
    - Specify the path to pscyr.map in the TEXCONFIG environment
      variable.


    pdfTeX:
  
    - Copy the .pfb, .enc, and pscyr.map files to where pdfTeX
      headers reside.
    - Add the string
         map +pscyr.map
      to the global configuration file pdftex.cfg.
    - If you don't have permission to modify the global
      pdftex.cfg (UNIX), modify local copy and specify its 
      location in the TEXPSHEADERS environment variable.



USAGE 

  * LaTeX

Once the installation is made for LaTeX, Cyrillic PostScript
fonts become available in LaTeX documents. For example,
   
   \usefont{T2A}{faq}{m}{n} 

loads the Antiqua font at medium weight and upright shape.  You
may redefine the default font family by issuing the command

   \renewcommand{\rmdefault}{faq} 

in the header. See the examples provided and the style file
pscyr.sty. Also look at the font definitions for available
weights and shapes for different font families.


  * Printing and previewing

After the document is converted to PostScript by DVIPS, it can be
visualized and printed with ghostscript/ghostview.

ATTENTION: Use DVIPS with -j0 option. Otherwise font re-encoding
           does not work properly.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

pdfLaTeX creates PDF directly from TeX source. This can be
printed and previewed with freely available Acrobat Reader.


  * Adding new fonts (UNIX only) 

You may use the perl scripts located in ./src to generate TeX
font metrics and the map file. These scripts are batch files for
afm2tfm program, which must be installed on your system. The
procedure is the following.

    - Copy Adobe font metrics of the new font to ./afm
   
    - Choose or create the appropriate encoding vector in ./enc.
    - Modify the file fontmap.txt in ./src. The syntax is

      TFM_NAME TMP_NAME AFM_NAME EFFECTS

      TFM_NAME : name of TeX font metrics file to create;
      TMP_NAME : unique name of temporary tfm file, which will be
                 created and erased by the script;
      AFM_NAME : name of Adobe font metrics file;

      EFFECTS  : E -extended, e - condensed, s - slanted. 
                 [012] - number of .enc file containing
                 the encoding vector.

    - Run the script make-all.sh. The .tfm and .map files will be
      created.

NOTES

The PSCYR package is unsupported, though serious bugs get fixed
somehow. The most serious problem is the quality of free fonts
included in the distribution: non-standard encodings, absent
ligatures, no kerning.

The typefaces included in this package originally come from   

    - The Monotype Corporation plc. (with changes by 
      Eugene V. Demidov);
    - Gavin Helf (with changes by Andrey A. Chernov);
    - ParaType, division of ParaGraph International.  

As to my knowledge, these fonts are placed into public domain and
can be freely redistributed.
